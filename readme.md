# Inspiration

Soil moisture is a measure of soil health, the water content present in a certain area of the ground. In my previous project Self Greenery, I build a Micro: bit Automated Self Watering Plant, so in this project, we will send the real-time soil moisture sensor data to qubitro for visualization.

# What it does

For this project, we will be using a node MCU ESP8266 WiFi module and a soil moisture sensor that measures the volumetric content of water inside the soil and we will send this sensor data for visualization in the Qubitro platform.
