# Inspiration

Soil moisture is a measure of soil health, the water content present in a certain area of the ground. In my previous project Self Greenery, I build a Micro: bit Automated Self Watering Plant, so in this project, we will send the real-time soil moisture sensor data to qubitro for visualization.

# What it does

For this project, we will be using a node MCU ESP8266 WiFi module and a soil moisture sensor that measures the volumetric content of water inside the soil and we will send this sensor data for visualization in the Qubitro platform.

# Hardware Requirements

NodeMCU ESP8266

FC-28 Soil moisture sensor

Breadboard, M-F Jumper wires

# Steps to follow 

Connect the soil moisture sensor FC-28 to the ESP8266 in analog mode.

VCC of FC-28 to 3.3V of ESP8266
GND of FC-28 to GND of ESP8266
A0 of FC-28 to A0 of ESP8266
Connect the two pins from the probe to the two pins on the Amplifier circuit via jumper wires.
